LOGO FILE LOCATION
==================

Place your logo file here: public/logo.png

The logo should be:
- Named: logo.png (lowercase)
- Format: PNG (preferably with transparent background)
- Colors: All black (as requested)
- Location: public/ folder (same folder as this file)

The public folder gets deployed with your website, so the logo will be accessible at:
https://yourdomain.com/logo.png

Current logo path in code: /logo.png
Used in: src/components/Navigation.tsx
